## Description

I was motivated to create Kendra's Tech Korner in order to formulate a Full-Stack web application that gave tech enthusiasts a platform to make posts regarding tech, web development, and more. I built this project to provide individuals a site to view and post information regarding the tech industry and to interact with one another via comments on other users posts. This site solves the problem of having a fully functional website that stores users' posts and comments in a back-end database. The technologies used in the app are Node.Js, Express.Js, Dotenv, Handlebars.Js, and MySql. This app also uses Bulma to style and follows the Model-Views-Controllers, or MVC, architecture framework. There are various npm packages used in the application as well that are visible in the package.json file. I learned how to create a full-stack web application during this process. Unfortunately, the project as it stands has various bugs that will be addressed upon further developemnt, and the deployed site will be updated to include these changes.

## Usage

Once you reach the app, you will be able to see previous users posts on the homepage. Upon clicking on one of these posts, you will be redirected to the log in/ sign up page where you must sign up, or log in if you do not already have an account. Once you have an account and are logged in, you will be redirected to your dashboard. On your dashboard you will have the opportunity to create a new post. When you navigate back to the homepage, you will see your post has populated. Once logged in, you will also be able to leave comments on other users posts as well. The update and delete functionalities are still being developed. Here is a link to the app, it currently is not working.
